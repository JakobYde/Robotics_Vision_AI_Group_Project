if SensorR is EXC and SensorL is EXC then Speed is Fast and Dir is Left
if SensorR is EXC and SensorL is C then Speed is Slow and Dir is L
if SensorR is EXC and SensorL is F then Speed is M and Dir is LL
if SensorR is C and SensorL is EXC then Speed is M and Dir is LR
if SensorR is C and SensorL is C then Speed is M and Dir is R
if SensorR is C and SensorL is F then Speed is M and Dir is L
if SensorR is F and SensorL is EXC then Speed is M and Dir is R
if SensorR is F and SensorL is C then Speed is M and Dir is R
